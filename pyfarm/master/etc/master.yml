# Configures if the underlying Flask application and other libraries
# should run in debug mode.
#
# **Production Note**: This value should always be false.
debug: true


# The URL to access the database.  For debugging and development
# a local SQLite database is used.  For production access should be
# configured to a more standard SQL database.  MySQL or Postgres are
# the two primary databases PyFarm is regurarly tested against.  For
# more information on the expected format of this variable see
# SQLAlchemy's documentation:
#   https://sqlalchemy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls
database: "sqlite:///pyfarm.sqlite"


# The name of this render farm, normally this can remain the default value.  If
# you're running multiple farms this allows you to only accept agents to your
# master that match your current farm name.
farm_name: ""


# The location where we'll store temporary files.  If not provided, this
# will default to using `tempfile.gettempdir()` once during startup.
tempdir: null


# The secret key which is used by several components of Flask
# for form validation, salting of secrets, etc.
#
# **Production Note**: This value should be random, consistent between
# frontends, and kept secret.  Do not use the value below for
# production.
secret_key: pyfarm


# The key used for signing the csrf token.
#
# **Production Note**: This value should be random, consistent between
# frontends, and kept secret.  Do not use the value below for
# production.

# The prefix of the URL from which the API will operate on.  This should
# not generally be changed unless you are operating different versions
# of the API at the same time from one web server.
api_prefix: /api/v1


# Enables or disable the login functionality.  This can be used when
# debugging or doing development but should not be changed for
# production.
login_disabled: false


# The amount of time the 'remeber me' cookie should persist.  The keys
# and values here are passed into a `timedelta` object as keywords.

  hours: 16


# When true json output from te APIs will be reformatted to
# be more human readable.

# When true all SQLAlchemy queries will be echoed.  This is useful
# for debugging the SQL statements being run and to get an idea of
# what the underlying ORM may be doing.
echo_sql: false


# When true the application will automatically create users in
# PyFarm's database if they do not exist already.  Setting this
# to false will cause an exception to be raised if the user in
# question does not exist.
autocreate_users: true


# When autocreating users, use this domain for the email address.  Not
# setting this value and setting `autocreate_users` to true will result
# in a users's email address not being set.

# The format for timestamps in the user interface.

# There's some validation that happens when an agent is added to the
# database.  One of the checks we have is to ensure the agent's address
# is a remote address which a loopback address normally is not considered
# 'remote'.  Changing this value to to true disable this and will allow
# agents from a local address to connect.
allow_agents_from_loopback: false


# The directory to store updates for agents.  This will use `tempdir` above
# as the base directory.
agent_updates_dir: $tempdir/pyfarm-updates


# Optional directory to serve GET requests for agent updates
# from.  This is different from `agent_updates_dir` in that it's
# only used when an agent is requested a file to update from.  This
# can be useful when you're caching requests or doing something with
# the update files prior to them being requested by the agent.
agent_updates_webdir: null


# The directory to store downloaded logs in.
#
# **Production Note**: For production it's probably best if these are kept
# in a persistent location rather than $tempdir.

flask_listen_address: 127.0.0.1


# When true all database tables will be dropped prior to setting

# When true we'll attempt to create any missing database tables
# prior to the application starting.  This is useful for development

# or drop tables.
